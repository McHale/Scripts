          <h3>About</h3>

<p>This is an open repository for OpenEUO scripts for <a href="http://www.uoex.net">Ultima Online: Excelsior Free Shard</a>. The goal of this project is to allow our community programmers to have access to a repository of scripts, especially ones that need to be cleaned, fix bugs, add more features, or implement a user interface/gui. This project also enables programmers to add their own scripts into this common repository. You don't have to have a GitHub login to be able to download this repository for personal use of the scripts.</p>

<p>In order to add to this repository or make changes to files in this repository, you must have a GitHub Username. Contact me on the <a href="http://www.uoex.net/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=3043" class="user-mention">Excelsior Forums</a>. Be sure to include in a Private Message, your GitHub Username to be added to the list of collaborators, as well as your in-game name.</p>

<h3>Getting Started With Git</h3>

<p>Git is a wonderful way to track and work with others on the same code base. There are many resources at there to help you get started with Git, which I'll include later on.
